# At Least the 3rd Best Fantasy Football App

Some friends and I decided to make a fantasy football team name generator! They bet me that I couldn't spin one out in an afternoon. They were wrong.

I used the `yo webapp` generator to spin up the front end, and firebase for data persistance. All data exported from excel as a csv, then manual C&P'ed per row into our seed json file.
